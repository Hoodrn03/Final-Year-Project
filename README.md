* I have found that when the colonist finds a tree using the literal distance algorithm I 
	used means that they will potentially travel longer to get to a tree; I would like 
	to refine this to ensure that the colonist will always take the shortest path to get 
	to the target. For the moment this is fine. Future problem.
